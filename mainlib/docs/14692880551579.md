```
针对20160615iMaker升级的内容对SC进行了同步更新，提升会员信息获取稳定性、增加手机号信息显示
改用Maven构建项目:不需要再根据环境创建war,解决了部署时版本难以确定的问题
自动初始化domain、port配置,关闭setup页面了,用对应filter.properties文件配置环境.提升效率、避免错误。
将平台参数抽取到filter.properties、server.properties中,更改方便了,不用修改源代码.
更改了日志的级别,避免log过大,现在设置为ERROR.
使用存储过程(PROCEDURE)改写fastpath的SQL升级语句，避免遇到执行错误后无法执行后续语句，造成插件无法正常使用的问题。同时，现在不需要手工执行SQL语句及配置adminConsole.frame-options的参数了，已经随SQL自动插入数据库。
修改了user-browser.jsp文件，修正了国际化造成的一个不易察觉的bug：OPENFIRE为中文时，无法显示最后一个添加用户按钮。另外，推荐尝试使用添加组功能管理客服。
```

####升级日志20160615（针对iMaker，SC平台未作修改）
- 升级版本：

优化

- 升级内容：  

```本次主要升级了iMaker平台的客服系统，获取会员信息时不再转换为MemeberDetailBean，因为一旦Member模块的Bean发生变动，转换可能会报错。事实上，SC系统就有过变动，此种情况需要及时更新Bean保持一致。现在改为获取Json字段。
增加了获取的会员信息，增加了手机号码。

- 升级内容：

add：
1、SIT、PRE、PROD环境一致了。
2、Openfire和Fastpath升级的适配，适配升级后某些类的变更。
3、Fastpath的国际化，支持多语言。
4、数据库升级的适配，兼容新版本。
5、不再使用GET请求页面跳转，提升安全性，提高稳定性，更美观。之前的表示方法客户可以通过替换username＝后面的内容冒充其他客户进行咨询。
表现为网址不再包含后缀：
（举个例子，现有版本咨询地址：http://chat.boetest.com.cn:8088/webchat/queue.jsp?username=%E5%8C%BF%E5%90%8D&chatID=5937111&question=%E5%94%AE%E5%90%8E%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1&workgroup=goumaizixun@workgroup.vm-10068-30264.novalocal，升级后的咨询地址：http://chat.boetest.com.cn:8088/webchat/chatmain.jsp）
6、＊启用了集群及热切换，针对单点Webchat及Openfire单点崩溃自动切换，保障客服24小时运行。
7、对客户评价及聊天内容进行过滤，避免客户恶意注入某些代码进行数据库攻击，造成无法查询、写入聊天记录等问题。客服需要将想过滤的词汇添加到OPENFIRE console的ContentFilter配置中。
8、启用了内容过滤，可以对不文明、敏感词进行过滤并报告。
9、＊启用了统计信息图表功能，并可以保存为PDF。

improvement：
1、完善了SQL脚本，可以自动升级数据库以匹配新版本及增加评价内容等数据列。
2、查询聊天记录和使用情况时，之前必须选择开始和结束日期，现在默认设置为以今天开始，以明天结束，这样即可直接查询当天的记录。
3、选择日历现在可以选择当月外的部分日期。如：2016年3月1日为星期二，不翻页的情况下，之前可以选择3月1日至3月31日之间的日期，现在可以选择2月28日至4月9日的日期，省却了部分日期跨月时翻页的步骤。
4、使用情况查询：优化了部分逻辑，减少了NULL报错的可能，减少了客服组名称的转换环节。
5、调整了客服组页面的状态栏居中对齐。
6、聊天记录查询导出页面展示内容国际化，根据OPENFIRE自动切换中英文语言（例如OPENFIRE中文情况下聊天记录显示为：[16:10:23] 匿名 进入了聊天室，[16:11:22] 匿名 离开了聊天室）。
7、提升了整体稳定性。

fix：
1、修复了客户有电子邮箱信息，客服却无法获取到的情况。
2、由于MemberDeatilBean更新，客户聊天无头像的错误。
3、设计字段容量过小，导致聊天记录内容超过65535无法写入数据库所有相关信息，并且导致聊天时间变为0秒的错误。
4、修复了Webchat发布后，配置好host信息，20秒内点击在线咨询报错的信息。
5、某些情况下，无法登录admin管理员的情况。

＊的内容是已开发但此次决定不升级的。
